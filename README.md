#Machine Learning on predicting stock returns | Imperial College Business School

This project in order to build a model to predict daily, stock-level returns out of sample, based on
lagged own and cross-stock returns, and lagged institutional trading flows of a given stock and other
stocks. Using machine-learning tools to exploit the rich cross-sectional information in cross-stock
returns and trading flows, and the possibly short-lived nature of useful trading signals in high-frequency
data
